The various reasons for it include seborrheic dermatitis and other conditions too like eczema, psoriasis, and allergy.  According to experts, the exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown.

The external ear is connected to the middle ear, which consists of a hollow cavity and some bones which are small in size but are of paramount importance. The middle ear is responsible for the transmission of sound waves from the external ear to the internal ear. The middle ear is connected to the nasopharynx- the part where your nose and throat are in continuity through the eustachian tubes. The middle ear is also connected to the internal ear- which is a complex structure that converts the mechanical signals received from the middle ear into electrical signals that the brain can understand. The inner ear contains bony and membranous structures and plays a major role in maintaining the body's balance.",
